## 📝 Description:

Our project is a simple yet powerful **To-Do List Web Application** that allows users to:
- Add tasks with categories and priorities
- Track task completion with progress bar
- Filter tasks (All, Pending, Completed)
- Store tasks locally using **LocalStorage**
- Navigate between task adding and listing pages

We used the following tech stack:
- **HTML** – Structure of the app
- **CSS + Bootstrap** – Styling and responsiveness
- **JavaScript** – Task management logic
- **FontAwesome** – Icons

This was developed as a team under the **L&T EduTech initiative** and gave us hands-on experience with real-world full-stack web development.
